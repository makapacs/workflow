            <li><b>Artifact</b><br>
                The artifact is theme, or widget or site all that can be products separatley packaged to be delivered to client
            </li>
            <li><b>Theme</b><br>
                This is an artifact that contains one or more themes(base theme plus the extenended one) from sites/all/themes directory often times
                with a custom module from (sites/all/modules) all of which to host one Drupal Theme
            </li>
            <li><b>Widget</b><br>
                This is an artifact that contains one or more modules from sites/all/modules directory to provide some functionality such as map, blog, slider, etc.
                It can be also referred as plug-in or add-on
            </li>
            <li><b>Site</b><br>
                This is an artifact that contains artifacts Theme(usually on) and Widgets all of which to host one fully functional site. To keep site specific
                development apart from the artifacts of theme and widgets there is an addition custom module for that purpose

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Important to note, that alias configurations - db-name, db-user, db-pwd will be overritten with ones user specifies at
            the time of execution if any</p>

    </section>
    <section id="artifacts">
        <h3>Artifacts</h3><hr>
        <h4>About Artifacts</h4>
        <p>The artifacts is what this is about. The WorkFlow tool builds packages from artifacts, deploys them, configures artifacts on instances and more.
           By default, there are two artifacts - widget and theme, but is not limited to only two. You can declare others(see Configurations section)</p>
        <p>In the following is artifact attributes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>name:</b>
                The name of the artifact. It has to be unique and the same across all declarations(aliases can be configured)
            </li>
            <li><b>type</b>
                The type of the artifact such as widget, theme, etc. All artifacts without type declared is of type 'widget'
            </li>
            <li><b>repo</b>
                The url of github account containing the repository of an artifact
            </li>
            <li><b>repo_name</b>
                the repository name in GitHub storing an artifact. The 'repo'/'repo_nam' combains full path to clone artifact
            </li>
            <li><b>branch</b>
                for developers its the branch in the GitHub repo. For business people, it may be the package of the deliverable(i.e. BASIC, PLUS, ULTIMATE)
            </li>
            <li><b>ver</b>
                The tag name of the git repository. This is used to version each artifact.
            </li>
            <li><b>final_name</b>
                the final name of artifacts as it is stored in the 'site/all/modules','sites/all/themes' directories or in devliveralbe package
            </li>
            <li><b>work_dir</b>
                the path to local working dir of the artifacts. It overrides the general 'work_dir' specified in environment configuration
            </li>
            <li><b>work_dir_name</b>
                the dir name of artifact in the local working directory.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Important to note, that one artifact will contain multiple dependencies that are other artifacts(with their own blueprints - make files). They all need to be declared the same way in the blueprint - make file of that main artifact being build, deployed or configured</p>
        <h4>Declaring In Blueprint</h4>
        <p>Each artifact can be declared in the make file as following:</p>
        <code>
            widget[commerce][name]=commerce
            widget[commerce][order]=1
            widget[commerce][final_name]=designssquare_com_widget_commerce
            widget[commerce][repo]=https://github.com/kapasoft-drupal-modules/
            widget[commerce][repo_name]=commerce
            widget[commerce][ver]=v.0.1
            widget[commerce][work_dir]=/path/to/local/work/dir
            widget[commerce][work_dir_name]=commerce_widget
            ...
            theme[bazar][name]=bazar
            theme[bazar][order]=0
            theme[bazar][final_name]=bazar
            theme[bazar][repo]=https://github.com/kapasoft-drupal-modules/
            theme[bazar][repo_name]=bazar-theme
            theme[bazar][ver]=v.0.3.1
            theme[bazar][work_dir_name]=bazar
            ...
            YOUR-TYPE[index][name]=name
            YOUR-TYPE[index][order]=0
            ...
        </code>
        <p>Here, we have declared two different type of artifacts. One is widget - commerce and another is theme - Bazar. When declaring artifacts in the make file there additional attribute 'order'
        that provides order of processing the artifacts, because some may depend on another.</p>
        <p>Important to note. The index of the artifact has to be the name</p>
        <p>You may notice that not all attributes are declared. Some attributes like 'work_dir' is declared in the environment configurations. Unless its different for specific artifact, you don't have to re-declare it in make file.
            All other attributes of artifact can be declared in the external artifact configuration once and only referred in the make file</p>
        <h4>Declaring In External Configurations</h4>
        <p>After a while, you will get tired re-declaring the artifacts in the make file, so to avoid this redundant task, there is available artifact external configurations
        to declare each artifact once and then reference in make file by name instead. In the make file you can also override any of the attribute such as 'ver',etc, since any attributes specified in make file
        will mask out ones declared in the external artifact configurations</p>
        <p>To declare artifacts externally, create a file 'artifacts.drushrc.php' and place it any path Drush searches for. Here is the sample format of 'artifacts.drushrc.php':</p>
        <code>
            //declaring artifacts
            $artifacts = array();
            $artifacts['lib'] = array(
            'name' => 'lib',
            'repo' => /path/to/repo,
            'repo_name' => 'designssquare-utils',
            'final_name' => 'designssquare_com_lib',
            'work_dir_name' => 'designssquare_lib',
            );
            $artifacts['sample_data'] = array(
            ...
            );
        </code>

    <section id="configurations">
        <h3>Configurations</h3><hr>
        <h4>Location of Configurations</h4>
        <p>The configurations are externalized into workflow.drush.inc in DRUSH_ROOT dir($HOME/.drush/ dir) or any location DRUSH searches</p>
        <h4>Available Environment Configurations</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><b>work_dir</b><br>
                full path of working directory that contains all of your widgets such as themes, modules, sites, etc categorized into dir 'themes', 'modules','sites',etc. This is where you do the
                the development. The packaging is done from the working directory. We recommend each of the widgets keep in its own git repository. If not specified, then defaults to directory - $HOME/workflow/work-dir
            </li>
            <li><b>make_root</b><br>
                full path to directory that contains the Blueprints - make files for each of the artifacts such as theme, module, site, etc. Just like working dir
                this directory is categorized into directories per widget type such as themes, modules, sites, etc. So, for example, all make files for modules are in dir 'make_root/modules' and make files for themes
                are in dir 'make_root/themes' and so on per artifact type. If 'make_root' is not specified in environment configurations, then it defaults to location - $HOME/workflow/blueprints
            </li>
            <li><b>dist</b><br>
                full path to directory that contains packages built & deliverable to client ready to be imported in another instance. For each artifact there is a separate dir. The artifact dir name is combined
                with 'prefix'-'artifact type'-'artifact name'. The artifact directory contains all of the packages versioned that are build so far.
            </li>
            <li><b>package_prefix</b><br>
                The package_prefix specifies the prefix added to the package name. For example, all pacakge at designssquare.com is prefixed with 'designssquare-com-'
            </li>
            <li><b>db_user</b><br>
                the database user used for site installation, etc if not specified at site alias configurations or at the time of execution
            </li>
            <li><b>db_pwd</b><br>
                the database user password used for site installation, etc if not specified at site alias configurations or at the time of execution
            </li>
            <li><b>make_file</b><br>
                the default make file for site installations, for shared actions,etc. If not specified in environment external configurations with 'make_file', then it defaults to make_root/build-drupal-core.make
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The configurations need to be formatted as array of name '$workflow_config' as following:</p>
        <code>
            $workflow_config = array();
            $workflow_config['work_dir'] = '/path/to/work/dir';
            $workflow_config['make_root'] = '/path/to/blueprints';
            $workflow_config['dist'] = '/path/to/distribution/dir';
            $workflow_config['package_prefix'] = 'designssquare-com-';
            $workflow_config['make_file'] = 'path/to/default-make-file.make';
            $workflow_config['db_user'] = 'username';
            $workflow_config['db_pwd'] = 'password';
        </code>
        <h4>Available Artifact Configurations</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><b>type</b><br>
                declare the available types of artifacts. By default, it declares - theme, widget types.
            </li>

        </ol>
        <h4>Formatting Artifact Configurations</h4>
        <p>The artifact configuration is an array of name $artifact_types containing all available artifact types</p>
        <code>
            $artifact_types = array();
            $artifact_types[] = 'widget';
            $artifact_types[] = 'theme';
        </code>
    </section>
    <section id="conventional">
        <h3>Conventions</h3><hr>
        <h4>Documentation</h4>
        <p>its assumed that each widget has its own documentation located at '/doc' dir. It is included in the package and moved into Drupal instance at the deployment</p>
        <h4>Package Naming</h4>
        <p>Package naming is combined with 'prefix'-'type'-'name'-'branch'-'min'-'ver'. Each widget also has its own make file and it is named the same as package name or if not present, then
           it looks up next less specific name in the following order:
          <ul>
                <li>'prefix'-'type'-'name'-'branch'-'min'-'ver'</li>
                <li>'prefix'-'type'-'name'-'branch'-'min'</li>
                <li>'prefix'-'type'-'name'-'branch'</li>
                <li>'prefix'-'type'-'name'</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, you have to have at least one general make file 'prefix'-'type'-'name' for each widget in order to process widget</p>

        <h4>Working Dir</h4>
        <p>In your environment configurations, you would specify the working directory of all artifacts such as themes, widgets, sites or any type of artifact you like to develop.
        It is a convention that each of type of artifact is in its own directory in the working directory, so widgets will be in 'work_dir/widgets' and themes are in 'work_dir/themes' and so on for any other type. You can overwrite
            this by specifying different work dir for each artifact in the make file with attribute 'work_dir'. If work_dir is not specified in the environment configurations, then defaults to location - $HOME/workflow/work-dir</p>

        <h4>Distribution Dir</h4>
        <p>
            This directory contains packages build and deliverable to client ready to be imported in another instance. Just like work directory, for each artifact there is a separate dir (i.e. themes, widgets,etc). The specific artifact dir name is combined
            with 'prefix'-'artifact type'-'artifact name'. The artifact directory contains all of the packages versioned that are build so far. Note, prefix can be configured in external env configurations(please, see configurations section)
            If 'dist' is not specified in environment configurations, then it defaults to location - $HOME/workflow/dist
        </p>
      <h4>Blueprints Dir</h4>
        <p>
            This directory contains blueprints for all artifacts. Just like work directory, for each artifact there is a separate dir (i.e. themes, widgets,etc). The specific artifact name is combined
            with 'prefix'-'artifact type'-'artifact name'. Note, prefix can be configured in external environment configurations(please, see configurations section). In environment configurations, you
             can specify the blueprint root dir via 'make_root'. If 'make_root' is not specified in environment configurations, then it defaults to location - $HOME/workflow/blueprints</p>

    <h3>Actions Overview</h3>
    <hr>
     <h4>About Actions</h4>
        <p>actions are some tasks that was created with intention to reuse. The WorkFlow comes with several already supported actions
            such as conifg-editor, config-audio,etc. Actions can be any drush command as well. Actions can be declared and reused in the make file
        The actions declared in the default make file(see external env configurations) are shared for all artifacts </p>
    <h4>Declaring Actions</h4>
        <p>The actions are declared in the blueprint(make file) as following</p>
        <code>
            action[load][name]=enable_artifact
            action[load][order]=0
            action[load][tag]=init
            action[load][param][]=designssquare_lib
            action[load][param][]=designssquare_lib_sample_data
            action[load][param][]=espresso

            action[default_theme][name]=set_default_theme
            action[default_theme][order]=3
            action[default_theme][tag]=init
            action[default_theme][param][]=espresso
        </code>
        Here, action named 'load' enables two modules - designssquare_lib, designssquare_lib_sample_data and theme "espresso". Afterwards, the action
        named 'default_theme' sets the default theme to be 'espresso'

        <h4>Solo Action</h4>
     <p>
         one way to execute actions is via drush command 'execute-action'[ea]. This executes one action at the time. Another way, to call single
         action is via drush command 'configure-artifact'[ca] and specify flag '--action=NAME-OF-ACTION' as described in the blueprint(make file)
     </p>
    <h4>Multiple Actions</h4>
        <p>
            The best way to call multiple actions is using 'tags'. When declaring actions, add tag, so, afterwards, you can call all actions with certain
            tag as following
            <code>
                drush ca ARTIFACT @ALIAS --tag=dev,init
            </code>
            This will call all actions with tag 'dev' and 'init'.
        </p>
        <p>
            In case, you like to call more than one but without tag mechanism, then you can specify list of actions to execute via flag 'action' as following:
            <code>
                drush ca ARTIFACT @ALIAS --action=ACTION-NAME1,ACTION-NAME2
            </code>
        </p>
    <h4>Actions Overview</h4>
        <p>list of available actions</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Name</th><th>Params</th><th>Description</th></tr>
        <tr><td>install-site</td><td>alias</td><td>install Drupal instance per make file provided in the destination of the alias or at the root/deploys/env_alias</td></tr>
        <tr>@ToDo...needs update</tr>
    </table>

        <h4>Passing Variables</h4>
        <p>You may have an action which takes an argument that is, perhaps, return of another action. Than you can declare it as variable with 'result'
            index and access it via '@' as following:</p>
        <code>
            action[get_make][name]=get_make_file
            action[get_make][order]=0
            action[get_make][tag]=config
            action[get_make][result]=make_file

            action[config_depend][name]=configure_all_dependencies
            action[config_depend][order]=1
            action[config_depend][tag]=config
            action[config_depend][param][]=@make_file
        </code>
        <p>Here, the action 'get_make' retrieves the make file and than store it in the variable "make_file" that is later reused as an argument in the action - "config_depend"</p>

        <h3>Deployment Cycles</h3><hr>
        <h4>DEV (development)</h4>
        <p>When deploying artifacts in DEV mode, it will link the artifacts to its appropriate repositories in the working directory, so changes you make are updated in the
            working directory. By convention, the location of working version of the artifact is located at 'work_dir'/'artifact type'/'artifact name'. This can be overwritten by 'work_dir', 'work_dir_name' attributes
        of artifact in blue print or artifact external configurations</p>
        <h4>TEST</h4>
        <p>When deploying artifacts in TEST mode, it will copy the artifacts from the appropriate package located in your local distribution directory, so before delivering to client
            the package is tested. The distribution dir is configured in the 'dist' variable in external tool configurations. By convention, the packages are stored in 'dist'/'artifact type'/'package name'</p>
        <h4>STAGE</h4>
        <p>When deploying artifacts in STAGE mode, it will clone the artifacts from external git hub repository per blue print(i.e make file) provided. This may be alternative method to deliver your artifacts. Instead of sending the package,
            you can only provide the blue print(i.e. make file) and your client can deploy it in STAGE mode that way retrieving all of your artifacts from git hub repository.
