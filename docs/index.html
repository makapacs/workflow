    <h3>About</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>Overall</h4>

    <p>WorkFlow is a tool used to build assets, deploy and configure these assets on drupal instances among other
        things</p>

    <p>Each asset contains any number of artifacts with one of the two types - widget and theme, but is not limited to
        only those two types.
        You can add any type at any given type</p>

    <p>Each asset has actions that are tasks that can be applied at the time of installation and configuration of
        asset</p>

    <p>Each asset has a blueprint or also known as make file. The blueprint specifies all the artifacts to include in
        the asset,
        the associated actions among other things for whenever you build, deploay or configure asset. There are 3 main
        ways to
        supply the blueprint from command line:
    <ol>
        <li><b>--asset:</b> by providing a name of asset, WorkFlow will locate the blueprint following conventions(see
            'conventions' section) and environment configurations (see 'External Environment Configurations' section)
        </li>
        <li><b>--package:</b> by providing dir of a package or compressed tar/zip file, it will take the make file
            located in the package directory
        </li>
        <li><b>--make:</b> by specifying directly the make file is another way</li>
    </ol>
    You only need to do one of the above to provide blueprint for tool to execute
    </p>
    <h4>Deployment Modes</h4>

    <p>When deploying asset, you have a choice to deploy it in one of the 3 forms - dev, test or stage. Each of the
        forms differ in how
        assets are downloaded and setup into your Drupal instance. In the
        following, is quick overview:
    <ul>
        <li><b>DEV:</b> artifacts are linked to from the working directory into the drupal instance for quick easy
            changes
        </li>
        <li><b>TEST:</b> artifacts are copied from package provided. This is perfect for testing before shipping asset
        </li>
        <li><b>STAGE:</b> artifacts are cloned from github.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Whats included?</h4>

    <h4>Terminology Terms </h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Asset</b><br>
            Asset is the product that combines together different artifacts and actions to provide some functionality,
            solve some problem. It is the deliverable you ship.
            Some examples of assets are theme, slider, blog, newsletter etc. or combined multiple of the items solving
            different problems into one asset deliverable and deployable on another Drupal instance.
            It's typical to have one main artifact and rest of them are dependent artifacts in one asset. Based on this
            main artifact type, we assign the artifact type to an asset be more descriptive
        </li>
        <li><b>Artifact</b><br>
            There are two types of artifacts - theme, widget that are all combined together to form an asset to provide
            one or many functionality such as slider, blog, calendar, etc.
        </li>
        <li><b>Theme</b><br>
            Theme is an artifact located at sites/all/themes directory by default. There is usually a dependent a custom
            module another artifact to provide functionality for a theme. There may else be base theme another artifact.
            All of these combined
            create asset of type theme
        </li>
        <li><b>Widget</b><br>
            Widget is an artifact that contains one or more modules to provide some functionality such as calendar,
            blog, slider, etc. By default, all widgets are stored in sites/all/modules dir
            It can also be referred as plug-in or add-on
        </li>
        <li><b>Action</b><br>
            Actions can be tasks such us configure video, install dependencies, etc. that are applied to Drupal instance
            during deployment/configuration stage. The tasks can also be individual actions
            such as check the uncommitted changes in working directory, scrap email addresses from file,etc. Actions are
            also any Drush command. The purpose of actions is to automate repetitive tasks that can be reused by
            declaring in blueprint(make file) and executing them all at once or per requirements. Actions can also be
            shared among assets and imported into deliverable package at the build process. See "Actions" section for
            details
        </li>
        <li><b>Package</b>
            Deliverable of asset that can be compressed in tar/zip format. It contains all the artifacts all arranged
            per directories - modules, themes
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>The 'prefix' is configured in the Tool configurations. See section "Configurations"</p>

    <p>Depending if the flags '--min', '--ver', '--branch' is provided, the package name is going to be constructed in
        the order from more specific to general as demostrated above</p>

<section id="asset_naming">
    <h3>Asset Naming</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>How To Install?</h4>

    <p>The final name of asset is combined with the prefix, type of artifact, name of artifact, branch name if present,

    <h4>Where is Make file located?</h4>

    <p>The make files is located in dir specified by environment configuration 'make_root' plus '/' plus 'type' of the
        artifact. The name of the make file is the same as the widget package or less specific </p>

        </li>
        <li><b>db-url</b>
            the database url for current drupal installation. If specified, than it will be used instead of
            db-user,db-pwd,db-name
            (i.e. $db_url = 'mysql://user-name:pass@127.0.0.1/db_name)

    </ul>
    <p>Important to note, that alias configurations - db-name, db-user, db-pwd will be overritten with ones user
        specifies at
        the time of execution if any</p>

<section id="artifacts">
    <h3>Artifacts</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>About Artifacts</h4>

    <p>The artifacts is what this is about. The WorkFlow tool builds packages from artifacts, deploys them, configures
        artifacts on instances and more.
        By default, there are two artifacts - widget and theme, but is not limited to only two. You can declare
        others(see Configurations section)</p>

    <p>In the following is artifact attributes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>name:</b>
            The name of the artifact. It has to be unique and the same across all declarations(aliases can be
            configured)
        </li>
        <li><b>type</b>
            The type of the artifact such as widget, theme, etc. All artifacts without type declared is of type 'widget'
        </li>
        <li><b>repo</b>
            The url of github account containing the repository of an artifact. Make sure there is forward slash at the
            end(ie. https://github.com/git-account/)
        </li>
        <li><b>repo_name</b>
            the repository name in GitHub storing an artifact. The 'repo'/'repo_nam' combains full path to clone
            artifact
        </li>
        <li><b>branch</b>
            for developers its the branch in the GitHub repo. For business people, it may be the package of the
            deliverable(i.e. BASIC, PLUS, ULTIMATE)
        </li>
        <li><b>ver</b>
            The tag name of the git repository. This is used to version each artifact.
        </li>
        <li><b>final_name</b>
            the final name of artifacts as it is stored in the 'site/all/modules','sites/all/themes' directories or in
            devliveralbe package
        </li>
        <li><b>work_dir</b>
            the path to local working dir of the artifacts. It overrides the general 'work_dir' specified in environment
            configuration
        </li>
        <li><b>work_dir_name</b>
            the dir name of artifact in the local working directory.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Important to note, that one artifact will contain multiple dependencies that are other artifacts(with their own
        blueprints - make files). They all need to be declared the same way in the blueprint - make file of that main
        artifact being build, deployed or configured</p>
    <h4>Declaring In Blueprint</h4>

    <p>Each artifact can be declared in the make file as following:</p>
    <code>
        widget[commerce][name]=commerce<br>
        widget[commerce][order]=1<br>
        widget[commerce][final_name]=designssquare_com_widget_commerce<br>
        widget[commerce][repo]=https://github.com/kapasoft-drupal-modules/<br>
        widget[commerce][repo_name]=commerce<br>
        widget[commerce][ver]=v.0.1<br>
        widget[commerce][work_dir]=/path/to/local/work/dir<br>
        widget[commerce][work_dir_name]=commerce_widget<br>
        ...
        theme[bazar][name]=bazar<br>
        theme[bazar][order]=0<br>
        theme[bazar][final_name]=bazar<br>
        theme[bazar][repo]=https://github.com/kapasoft-drupal-modules/<br>
        theme[bazar][repo_name]=bazar-theme<br>
        theme[bazar][ver]=v.0.3.1<br>
        theme[bazar][work_dir_name]=bazar<br>
        ...<br>
        YOUR-TYPE[index][name]=name<br>
        YOUR-TYPE[index][order]=0<br>
        ...<br>
    </code>

    <p>Here, we have declared two different type of artifacts. One is widget - commerce and another is theme - Bazar.
        When declaring artifacts in the make file there additional attribute 'order'
        that provides order of processing the artifacts, because some may depend on another.</p>

    <p>Important to note. The index of the artifact has to be the name</p>

    <p>You may notice that not all attributes are declared. Some attributes like 'work_dir' is declared in the
        environment configurations. Unless its different for specific artifact, you don't have to re-declare it in make
        file.
        All other attributes of artifact can be declared in the external artifact configuration once and only referred
        in the make file</p>
    <h4>Declaring In External Configurations</h4>

    <p>After a while, you will get tired re-declaring the artifacts in the make file, so to avoid this redundant task,
        there is available artifact external configurations
        to declare each artifact once and then reference in make file by name instead. In the make file you can also
        override any of the attribute such as 'ver',etc, since any attributes specified in make file
        will mask out ones declared in the external artifact configurations</p>

    <p>To declare artifacts externally, create a file 'artifacts.drushrc.php' and place it any path Drush searches for.
        Here is the sample format of 'artifacts.drushrc.php':</p>
    <code>
        //declaring artifacts<br>
        $artifacts = array();<br>
        $artifacts['lib'] = array(<br>
        'name' => 'lib',<br>
        'repo' => /path/to/repo,<br>
        'repo_name' => 'designssquare-utils',<br>
        'final_name' => 'designssquare_com_lib',<br>
        'work_dir_name' => 'designssquare_lib',<br>
        );<br>
        $artifacts['sample_data'] = array(<br>
        ...<br>
        );<br>

    <h3>Environment Configurations</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>Location of Configurations</h4>

    <p>The configurations are externalized into workflow.drush.inc in DRUSH_ROOT dir($HOME/.drush/ dir) or any location
        DRUSH searches</p>
    <h4>Available Environment Configurations</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><b>work_dir</b><br>
            full path of working directory that contains all of your widgets such as themes, modules, sites, etc
            categorized into dir 'themes', 'modules','sites',etc. This is where you do the
            the development. The packaging is done from the working directory. We recommend each of the widgets keep in
            its own git repository. If not specified, then defaults to directory - $HOME/workflow/work-dir
        </li>
        <li><b>make_root</b><br>
            full path to directory that contains the Blueprints - make files for each of the artifacts such as theme,
            module, site, etc. Just like working dir
            this directory is categorized into directories per widget type such as themes, modules, sites, etc. So, for
            example, all make files for modules are in dir 'make_root/modules' and make files for themes
            are in dir 'make_root/themes' and so on per artifact type. If 'make_root' is not specified in environment
            configurations, then it defaults to location - $HOME/workflow/blueprints
        </li>
        <li><b>dist</b><br>
            full path to directory that contains packages built & deliverable to client ready to be imported in another
            instance. For each artifact there is a separate dir. The artifact dir name is combined
            with 'prefix'-'artifact type'-'artifact name'. The artifact directory contains all of the packages versioned
            that are build so far.
        </li>
        <li><b>package_prefix</b><br>
            The package_prefix specifies the prefix added to the package name. For example, all pacakge at
            designssquare.com is prefixed with 'designssquare-com-'
        </li>
        <li><b>db_user</b><br>
            the database user used for site installation, etc if not specified at site alias configurations or at the
            time of execution
        </li>
        <li><b>db_pwd</b><br>
            the database user password used for site installation, etc if not specified at site alias configurations or
            at the time of execution
        </li>
        <li><b>make_file</b><br>
            the default make file for site installations, for shared actions,etc. If not specified in environment
            external configurations with 'make_file', then it defaults to make_root/build-drupal-core.make
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Formatting Environment Configurations</h4>

    <p>The configurations need to be formatted as array of name '$workflow_config' as following:</p>
    <code>
        $workflow_config = array();<br>
        $workflow_config['work_dir'] = '/path/to/work/dir';<br>
        $workflow_config['make_root'] = '/path/to/blueprints';<br>
        $workflow_config['dist'] = '/path/to/distribution/dir';<br>
        $workflow_config['package_prefix'] = 'designssquare-com-';<br>
        $workflow_config['make_file'] = 'path/to/default-make-file.make';<br>
        $workflow_config['db_user'] = 'username';<br>
        $workflow_config['db_pwd'] = 'password';<br>
    </code>
    <h4>Available Artifact Configurations</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><b>type</b><br>
            declare the available types of artifacts. By default, it declares - theme, widget types.
        </li>

    </ol>
    <h4>Formatting Artifact Configurations</h4>

    <p>The artifact configuration is an array of name $artifact_types containing all available artifact types</p>
    <code>
        $artifact_types = array();<br>
        $artifact_types[] = 'widget';<br>
        $artifact_types[] = 'theme';<br>
    </code>
</section>
<section id="conventional">
    <h3>Conventions</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>Documentation</h4>

    <p>its assumed that each widget has its own documentation located at '/doc' dir. It is included in the package and
        moved into Drupal instance at the deployment</p>
    <h4>Package Naming</h4>

    <p>Package naming is combined with 'prefix'-'type'-'name'-'branch'-'min'-'ver'. Each widget also has its own make
        file and it is named the same as package name or if not present, then
        it looks up next less specific name in the following order:
    <ul>
        <li>'prefix'-'type'-'name'-'branch'-'min'-'ver'</li>
        <li>'prefix'-'type'-'name'-'branch'-'min'</li>
        <li>'prefix'-'type'-'name'-'branch'</li>
        <li>'prefix'-'type'-'name'</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, you have to have at least one general make file 'prefix'-'type'-'name' for each artifact in order to process
        artifact</p>

    <h4>Working Dir</h4>

    <p>In your environment configurations, you would specify the working directory of all artifacts such as themes,
        widgets, sites or any type of artifact you like to develop.
        It is a convention that each of type of artifact is in its own directory in the working directory, so widgets
        will be in 'work_dir/widgets' and themes are in 'work_dir/themes' and so on for any other type. You can
        overwrite
        this by specifying different work dir for each artifact in the make file with attribute 'work_dir'. If work_dir
        is not specified in the environment configurations, then defaults to location - $HOME/workflow/work-dir</p>

    <h4>Distribution Dir</h4>

    <p>
        This directory contains packages build and deliverable to client ready to be imported in another instance. Just
        like work directory, for each artifact there is a separate dir (i.e. themes, widgets,etc). The specific artifact
        dir name is combined
        with 'prefix'-'artifact type'-'artifact name'. The artifact directory contains all of the packages versioned
        that are build so far. Note, prefix can be configured in external env configurations(please, see configurations
        section)
        If 'dist' is not specified in environment configurations, then it defaults to location - $HOME/workflow/dist
    </p>
    <h4>Blueprints Dir</h4>

    <p>
        This directory contains blueprints for all artifacts. Just like work directory, for each artifact there is a
        separate dir (i.e. themes, widgets,etc). The specific artifact name is combined
        with 'prefix'-'artifact type'-'artifact name'. Note, prefix can be configured in external environment
        configurations(please, see configurations section). In environment configurations, you
        can specify the blueprint root dir via 'make_root'. If 'make_root' is not specified in environment
        configurations, then it defaults to location - $HOME/workflow/blueprints</p>

<section id="actions">
    <h3>Actions Overview</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>About Actions</h4>

    <p>actions are some tasks that was created with intention to reuse. The WorkFlow comes with several already
        supported actions
        such as conifg-editor, config-audio,etc. Actions can be any drush command as well. Actions can be declared and
        reused in the make file
        The actions declared in the default make file(see external env configurations) are shared for all artifacts </p>
    <h4>Declaring Actions</h4>

    <p>The actions are declared in the blueprint(make file) as following</p>
    <code>
        action[load][name]=enable_artifact<br>
        action[load][order]=0<br>
        action[load][tag]=init<br>
        action[load][param][]=designssquare_lib<br>
        action[load][param][]=designssquare_lib_sample_data<br>
        action[load][param][]=espresso<br>

        action[default_theme][name]=set_default_theme<br>
        action[default_theme][order]=3<br>
        action[default_theme][tag]=init<br>
        action[default_theme][param][]=espresso<br>

    </code>
    Here, action named 'load' enables two modules - designssquare_lib, designssquare_lib_sample_data and theme
    "espresso". Afterwards, the action
    named 'default_theme' sets the default theme to be 'espresso'

    <h4>Solo Action</h4>

    <p>
        one way to execute actions is via drush command 'execute-action'[ea]. This executes one action at the time.
        Another way, to call single
        action is via drush command 'configure-artifact'[ca] and specify flag '--action=NAME-OF-ACTION' as described in
        the blueprint(make file)
    </p>
    <h4>Multiple Actions</h4>

    <p>
        The best way to call multiple actions is using 'tags'. When declaring actions, add tag, so, afterwards, you can
        call all actions with certain
        tag as following
        <code>
            drush ca ARTIFACT @ALIAS --tag=dev,init
        </code>
        This will call all actions with tag 'dev' and 'init'.
    </p>

    <p>
        In case, you like to call more than one but without tag mechanism, then you can specify list of actions
        themselves to execute via flag 'action' as following:
        <code>
            drush ca ARTIFACT @ALIAS --action=ACTION-NAME1,ACTION-NAME2
        </code>
    </p>
    <h4>Actions Overview</h4>

    <p>list of available actions</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Params</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>install-site</td>
            <td>alias</td>
            <td>install Drupal instance per make file provided in the destination of the alias or at the
                root/deploys/env_alias
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>@ToDo...needs update</tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Sharing Actions</h4>

    <p>there may be actions that you like to share among the artifacts. So, you don't have to re-declare those actions
        for each artifact, you can put them in the default
        make file as declared with 'make_file' at external environment configuration. To ensure these shared actions are
        imported in the final make file part of the package, place their
        declarations within text tokens - ";WF_START", ";WF_END"
    </p>
    <h4>Passing Variables</h4>

    <p>You may have an action which takes an argument that is, perhaps, return of another action. Than you can declare
        it as variable with 'result'
        index and access it via '@' as following:</p>
    <code>
        action[get_make][name]=get_make_file<br>
        action[get_make][order]=0<br>
        action[get_make][tag]=config<br>
        action[get_make][result]=make_file<br>

        action[config_depend][name]=configure_all_dependencies<br>
        action[config_depend][order]=1<br>
        action[config_depend][tag]=config<br>
        action[config_depend][param][]=@make_file<br>
    </code>

    <p>Here, the action 'get_make' retrieves the make file and than store it in the variable "make_file" that is later
        reused as an argument in the action - "config_depend"</p>

    <p>Note: sharing variables are only supported for command - execute-action</p>

    <h3>Deployment Cycles</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>DEV (development)</h4>

    <p>When deploying artifacts in DEV mode, it will link the artifacts to its appropriate repositories in the working
        directory, so changes you make are updated in the
        working directory. By convention, the location of working version of the artifact is located at
        'work_dir'/'artifact type'/'artifact name'. This can be overwritten by 'work_dir', 'work_dir_name' attributes
        of artifact in blueprint or artifact external configurations</p>
    <h4>TEST</h4>

    <p>When deploying artifacts in TEST mode, it will copy the artifacts from the appropriate package located in your
        local distribution directory, so before delivering to client
        the package is tested. The distribution dir is configured in the 'dist' variable in external tool
        configurations. By convention, the packages are stored in 'dist'/'artifact type'/'package name'</p>
    <h4>STAGE</h4>

    <p>When deploying artifacts in STAGE mode, it will clone the artifacts from external git hub repository per
        blueprint(i.e make file) provided. This may be alternative method to deliver your artifacts. Instead of sending
        the package,
        you can only provide the blueprint(i.e. make file) and your client can deploy it in STAGE mode that way
        retrieving all of your artifacts
        from git hub repository.

    <h4>Tags Overview</h4>

    <p>WorkFlow has actions that are tasks to do something such as configure audio, enable editor, etc. A larger task
        such as configure video may take many smaller tasks(i.e download lib, enable modules, link library,etc), so to
        better handle this we have tags.
        You can assign one or many tags to each action in that way grouping common tasks together that can be triggered
        based on one tag. In another words,
        you can DRush command 'execute-action'[ea] and provide a tag which will take and execute all actions associated
        with this tag.
    </p>

    <p>Actions are also declarative and are declared in blueprint(make file). This provides a way for you repeat actions
        whenever you wish. It also provides
        way for you to share actions. In WorkFlow, the shared actions are imported at the build process into all
        packages, so you can reuse them. Here is
        how you can call them</p>
    <code>
        drush ca @ALIAS --tag=TAG-NAME --asset=ASSET-NAME<br>
        drush ca @ALIAS --tag=TAG-NAME --make=path/to/make/file<br>
        drush ca @ALIAS --tag=TAG-NAME --package=path/to/package<br>
    </code>

    <p>So, by providing tag, you would call different tasks</p>
    <h4>Tags Overview</h4>

    <p>In the following is overview of available task out of box from WorkFlow</p>

        Clone the tool from github repo - https://github.com/makapacs/workflow
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Incorporate With Drush</b><br>
        Update $options['include'] to include path to the tool with '/commands' in Drush configuration file
        drushrc.php (usually in $HOME/.drush dir)
        <code>
            $options['include'] = array('/path/to/Artifact Workflow tool/commands');
        </code>
    </li>
    <li><p>choose one of the two:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grab WorkFlow Sandbox from https://github.com/makapacs/workflow-sandbox and start develop. NO
                CONFIGURATION NEEDED
            </li>
            <li><b>Configure Your Environment</b><br>
                Specify your Environment(working dir, distribution dir, etc.) in the workflow.drushrc.php and place
                it in to DRUSH_ROOT dir as
                described in <a href="#!/configurations">'Configuration' section</a></li>
        </ul>

    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Update Aliases</b>
        Add additional configurations such db user, db password,etc to alias. Please, see <a href="#!/alias_config">Alias
        Configuration section</a>
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>How to setup Workflow?</h4>

<p>You can manually set up environment as specified at <a href="#!/configurations">'Environment Configuration'</a>
    section or
    clone <a href="https://github.com/makapacs/workflow-sandbox" target="_blank">WorkFlow Sandbox</a> that comes
    with default environment setup.</p>

<p>Note: when cloning WorkFlow Sandbox, make sure it's cloned into your $HOME/workflow dir to work</p>
<h4>How to add new Artifact(i.e. widget,theme,etc)?</h4>

<p>In the following are steps on configuring new widget(i.e. map widget)

<ol>
    <li>Create repository in Github.com for the new artifact</li>
    <li>Declare artifact in the artifact configuration file located at $HOME/.drush/artifact.drushrc.php or
        $HOME/workflow/artifact.drushrc.php. Please, see details in <a href="#!/artifacts">Artifacts</a> section
    </li>
    <li>From here, you can do one of the two:
        <ol>
            <li><p>Do it manually:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create working directory for the new artifact</li>
                    <li>Add info and other files necessary for Drupal module or theme</li>
                    <li>Hook the new working directory with github. In the new working directory:<br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>initalize git repo(<code>git init</code>)</li>
                            <li>add new files(<code>git add .</code>)</li>
                            <li>commit (<code>git commit -m "first commit"</code>)</li>
                            <li>add remote repository(<code>git remote add origin url-of-git-repo.git</code>)</li>
                            <li>push it(<code>git push origin master</code>)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Call action to create boilerplate and hook the git repo automatically for you</p><br>
                <code>drush ea create_artifact --param=ARTIFACT-NAME</code>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
<h4>How to spin new Drupal instance?</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Configure Virtual Host</b>

        <p>Virtual host needs to be configured to service the new Drupal Instance. On how to configuring Virtual
            Host, it is out of scope for this documentation.
            Please, see post <a href="http://margotskapacs.com/2013/09/installing-apache-on-mac/"> Installing Apache
                On Mac</a> in section on "Virtual Host" or refer
            any other resources on how to configure virtual host</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Configure Database</b>

        <p>
            You have to create new Database name, perhaps DB Username and Password as well.
        <ol>
            <li><b>Login in your mysql</b><br>
                <code>mysql -u root -p </code>
            </li>
            <li><b>Create Database</b><br>
                <code>create database DB-NAME;</code>
            </li>
            <li><b>Create User and Password</b>
                <code>grant all privileges on DB-NAME.* to USER-NaME@'localhost' identified by 'USER-PASS';</code>
            </li>
            <li><b>Flush It</b>
                <code>flush privileges;</code>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Configure Alias Settings</b><br>

        <p>Besides default Drush $alias settings, here the addition needed:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Db User(db-user)</b>
                <code>'db-user' => 'dev_metronic',</code></li>
            <li><b>Db Password(db-pwd)</b>
                <code>'db-pwd' => 'pass',</code></li>
            <li><b>Db Name(db-name)</b>
                <code>'db-name' => 'dev_metronic_db',</code></li>
            <li><b>[OPTIONAL]Default Make File(make-file)</b>
                <code>'make-file' => 'path/to/default/build-drupal-core.make',</code></li>
        </ul>
        For more info, please, see section on <a href="#!/alias_config">Alias Configurations</a>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Configure Local Lookup Table</b>

        <p>To ensure the request to the new instance are routed correctly, update your local look up table(ie. for mac
            /etc/hosts)
            <code>127.0.0.1 URI</code>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Spin It</b><br>
        <code>drush is @ALIAS-NAME</code>
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>How to Build Asset For First Time</h4>
<ol>
    <li><b>Create Asset Blueprint</b><br>

        <p>Every asset has its blueprint the make file. So, start by creating make file for your new asset about to
            build. If you are not going to provide
            this make file from command line with '--make' option, then WorkFlow will look for one at
            $BLUEPRINT/type(s)/PRE-FEX-TYPE-NAME-VER.make (see more in <a href="#!/asset_naming">Asset Naming
                section)</a></p>

        <p>In the make file, declare the artifacts you like to be included. In the following is make file for asset -
            Drupal Metronic Theme that will help you start</p>
        <code>
            ...<br>
            ;;WIDGETS<br>
            widget[lib][name]=lib<br>
            widget[lib][order]=1<br>
            widget[lib][ver]=v.0.2.2<br>
            widget[sample_data][name]=sample_data<br>
            widget[sample_data][order]=2<br>
            widget[sample_data][ver]=v.0.1<br>
            widget[metronic_theme][name]=metronic_theme<br>
            widget[metronic_theme][order]=4<br>
            widget[metronic_theme][ver]=v0.0.0<br>
            widget[utils_ckeditor][name]=utils_ckeditor<br>
            widget[utils_ckeditor][order]=5<br>
            widget[utils_ckeditor][ver]=v0.1.0<br>
            <br>
            ;;THEMES<br>
            theme[bootstrap][name]=bootstrap<br>
            theme[bootstrap][order]=1<br>
            theme[bootstrap][ver]=v0.1<br>
            theme[metronic][name]=metronic<br>
            theme[metronic][order]=2<br>
            theme[metronic][ver]=v0.0.0<br>
            ...<br>
            ;;ACTIONS<br>
            ...<br>
            projects[jquery_update][version] = 2.x-dev<br>
            projects[] = context<br>
            projects[] = ctools<br>
            projects[] = features<br>
            projects[] = strongarm<br>
            projects[] = features_extra<br>
            projects[] = views
            projects[] = entity
            projects[] = pathauto
            projects[uuid][version] = 1.x-dev
            projects[uuid_features][version] = 1.x-dev
        </code>

        <p>Here we add some shared dependencies such as lib, sample_data for exporting via features, utils_ckeditor for
            our custom ckeditor with
            20 most popular free CKEditor plugins. The metronic_theme is custom module providing functionality to drupal
            theme - Metronic an asset we are building.
            As you see version is v0.0.0 is assigned because we utilized action to build the boilerplate that adds the
            v0.0.0 at the generation.</p>

        <p>The asset - Drupal Theme Metronic is going to have two themes - the base theme Bootstrap and custom Metronic.
            Actions will go in this make file later
            once we ready to deploy. At last, all other dependencies and their versions are included</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Build Asset</b><br>

        <p>Once you have the make file, you ready to build</p>
        <code>
            drush ba metronic theme --ver=0.1
        </code>

        <p>--OR--</p>
        <code>
            drush ba metronic theme --make=themes/prefix-type-metronic-0.1.make --ver=0.1
        </code>

        <p>Here we are building asset of type theme named metronic.
            For the first one, WorkFlow will try to locate the make file per conventions with
            version 0.1 attached at the end. Please, see sections on <a href="#!/asset_naming">Asset Naming</a>
            and <a href="#!/configurations">Conventions</a>. For the second, you can specify relative path to make file
            from your $MAKE_ROOT
            as declared in the environment configurations</p>
    </li>
    <p>On success, look into $DIST/TYPE(s)/ directory for the newly built asset</p>
</ol>
<h4>How to deploy asset?</h4>

<p>Once you have the package built, spin up Drupal instance and lets deploy. In the following, there are three different ways
    to deploy based on the
    method you provide make file</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Directly Providing Blueprint via "--make"</b><br>
        <code>
            drush da @dev-metronic --make=themes/PREFIX-theme-metronic-0.1.make --env=dev
        </code>
    </li>
    <li><b>By Specifying Package via "--package"</b><br>

        <p>since each package contains make file, we can specify the package as following</p>
        <code>
            drush da @dev-metronic
            --package=themes/designssquare-com-theme-metronic/designssquare-com-theme-metronic-0.1 --env=test
        </code>
        <p>--OR--</p>
        <code>
            drush da @dev-metronic --package=themes/designssquare-com-theme-metronic/designssquare-com-theme-metronic-0.1.tar.gz --env=test
        </code>
        <p>Here again, we specify path to package direcotry or compressed package relative to distribution directory as specified in WorkFlow evironment variable "dist"  </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>By Specifying Asset via "--asset" & "--ver" & "--branch"</b><br>
        <code>
            drush da @dev-metronic --asset=metronic --ver=0.1 --env=stage
        </code>

        <p>this will use the artifact configurations(see <a href="#!/artifacts">Artifacts Configurations</a>) with conventions(see <a href="#!/configurations">Conventions</a>) to locate make file for the particular asset.</p>
    </li>
    <p>From the above, you can see the "env" was provided as well. Please, see section <a href="#!/deployments">"Deployments"</a>
        about three different ways to deploy based on "env"</p>
</ol>

    <p>When troubleshooting issue, its helpful to turn on logging. There are two levels important to mention</p>
    <ul>
        <li>notice: To turn on add flag '--verbose' to the Drush command. This will print all messages of progress as
            the execution takes place
        </li>
        <li>debug: To turn on add flag '--debug' to the Drush command. Besides 'notice' message, this will print all
